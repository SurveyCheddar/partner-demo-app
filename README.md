# Survey Cheddar Partner Program: A Practical Approach to Starting Your Business

Welcome to the Survey Cheddar Partner Program. This initiative is designed for individuals who are considering a step into entrepreneurship and are looking for a reliable and straightforward way to begin.

**About Survey Cheddar:** We specialize in market research, focusing on collecting consumer insights while enabling participants to earn through surveys. Our API provides access to a wide range of surveys, and we handle aspects like user payments, fraud detection, and security. This allows our partners to concentrate on developing applications that engage users.

**Program Benefits:**

- **Monetized Info:** Businesses need feedback on their products and marketing strategies. They compensate for these insights, particularly from specific demographic groups. As a partner, you receive a share of the revenue generated from surveys completed via your app
- **Technical Accessibility:** We offer a pre-configured React Native project for easy integration with our survey system. This setup is manageable even for those with basic technical skills, enabling the creation of a functional survey app
- **Support and Guidance:** Our program is more than a business opportunity; it's a partnership. We provide support and resources to help you navigate the early stages of your business venture
- **Room to Grow:** This is a massive multi-billion dollar industry, and there's plenty of room for more players. As users demand more privacy, less responsible older methods for getting info like user tracking become less viable. Many companies are turning to surveys for customer info
- **You're in Control:** You own your app, and you own your company, so you're always in the driver's seat
